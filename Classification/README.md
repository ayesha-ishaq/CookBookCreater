### Recipe Title Classification:
To run classification on any food image run:
1. First attain annotation files from dataset files in the appropriate format for training and evaluation use: <pre>data_preprocessing.ipynb</pre> Set the paths to your data files accordingly.
2. To run and evaluate classification using Resnet-50 use <pre>classification.ipynb</pre>

You can find pre-trained weights for classification model <a href="https://mbzuaiac-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ayesha_ishaq_mbzuai_ac_ae/EUSAaRCEgypLllsL7LhGwMoBpo2soB1sa1E0oA4aDeaC2Q?e=DHNLvJ">here</a>. 

Note: We attempted classification of food titles as an experiment, however we did not find it to be the appropriate approach for predicting food titles from images.
